# Roboto

Roboto is a compiled scripting language for C++ 
It aim at having a syntax close to C++ as well

What work:

*   variable (int only for now)
*   arithmetic (+ - * /)
*   comparaison (== < > <= >=)
*   logic operator(! && ||)
*   assignment (=)
*   if statement (else and else if too)
*   loops (while only because for is retarded and im lazy(i'll do it latter i promise))
*   function (suport multiple arguments, can have multiple function with same name if they dont have same signature)
*   binding c++ function (can bind c++ function and call them from roboto)
*   c++-like linker (you can declare something in one file and defien it in another one)

Todo:
*   Lot's of stuffs
